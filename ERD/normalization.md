# Database Normalization

## First Normal Form (1NF)
- **What was changed:** [Describe the changes made to achieve 1NF, e.g., "Eliminated repeating groups, ensured all attributes are atomic."]
- **Justification:** [Explain why these changes were needed.]

## Second Normal Form (2NF)
- **What was changed:** [Describe how the database design was adjusted to meet 2NF, e.g., "Removed partial dependency, ensured non-prime attributes are fully dependent on the primary key."]
- **Justification:** [Explain why these changes were necessary.]

## Third Normal Form (3NF)
- **What was changed:** [Describe how the design meets 3NF, e.g., "Eliminated transitive dependency by creating a separate table for..."]
- **Justification:** [Explain why these changes were important for 3NF.]

## Conclusion
- [Provide a brief conclusion about how the database now follows 3NF and why normalization is crucial for data integrity and efficiency.]
