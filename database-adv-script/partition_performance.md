# Partition Performance Report

## Objective
To implement partitioning on the Booking table based on the `start_date` column to improve query performance for date-based queries.

## Original Query Performance
- Query before partitioning:
    - Execution time: [Insert execution time from `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`]
    - Observed issues: [Describe any issues, such as long scan times]

## Partitioned Query Performance
- Query after partitioning:
    - Execution time: [Insert execution time from `EXPLAIN ANALYZE`]
    - Observed improvements: [Describe how the query performance improved]
    - Efficient partitioning based on the `start_date` column allows for faster queries on date ranges.

## Conclusion
- Partitioning significantly improved query performance for date-based queries by limiting the scanned data to relevant partitions.
- Further optimizations could include creating additional partitions for different date ranges or indexing frequently queried columns.
